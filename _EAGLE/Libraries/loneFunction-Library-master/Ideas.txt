- Polygon manager dialog window. List all polygons and have checkboxes to enable disable them. Ulp for ratsnest will look in config file whether to pour or not.

- Test to see if CONTEXT/MENU items can be modified on the fly from scr/ulp. This could be helpful to make toggles.
	-I don't this is possible. A ulp could keep track of toggle state using eaglerc to store states. No visual feedback though.

- AutoHotKey script to build quick launch dialog around mouse when left+middle held together. Place to add most used scripts, ulps, settings for quick access. Operation, hold mouse buttons together, hover item, release to launch. Radial Menu 4

- Airwire hidden list. Opens dialog that shows all hidden nets, with option to toggle show.

- RIPUP: Enable ripping up joints, similar to Cmd.Delete.WireJointsWithoutCtrl but for routes.

- Hide airwires that only connect on one side. If there are 2 places of copper connected on the top layer and there are no vias or pads, if top is not visible, hide those airwires.

- Take out the 'FINEST' buttons in the grid dialog. When would that ever been useful and sucks to accidentally hit.

- PAD: In library, number typed set diameter. Would be better if it set the drill.

- Add ability to save/load net class presets.

- LIBRARY: There's no way to replace a symbol in device. Even if it's a copy with no pin name changes, just different name. Easy to do in the text.

- SCH: Add snap (green circle) indicator to nets.

- SCH: Labels should still have Xref for same sheet nets. That verifies that it is connected somewhere else on the sheet.

- SCH: Select nets with line tool. Draw line, any nets that it crosses gets put into group.

- Use SELECT ulp type of saving and recalling groups to enable showing of saved groups. Could have a dialog to save, edit, and delete show groups

- Add CHANGE ANGLE option.

- Show alt grid while hold alt. Maybe overlaid with both.

- Tolerance input to show on dimension 

- Transer group on paste.

- Solo Layer in DISPLAY. Visibility icon + solo 

- DISPLAY can run multiple aliases (classes anyone ;)
		DISPLAY name 
		Expands the alias with the given name and executes the DISPLAY command with the resulting set of parameters. The name may be abbreviated and there may be other parameters before and after the alias (even other aliases).
		Display alias parameters can even contain other alias names!!!! \
		You can subtract presets as well. -_copper removes the ones saved in copper.
		
- VIA: Typing number into command currently sets diameter. It should change drill.

- Enable using Name field in info to rename Signal. Currently errors 'already exists'
