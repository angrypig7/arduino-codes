Quick settings ULP tool launcher.
A ulp to run before launching any drawing tool to change layers or other settings.

Some tools change the display when activating due to the active set layer being hidden. The display last command cannot undo this change. To ensure consistent diplay a ulp dialog will be used to change the layer.

Have an option to be able to select any layer or only visible. only visible would always keep the diplay settings intact when switching tools (default).

More advanced launcher could be designed to have default layers for certain tools. (DIMENSION set to 47 Measures).
