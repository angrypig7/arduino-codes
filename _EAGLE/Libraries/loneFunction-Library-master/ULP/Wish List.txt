This is a wishlist of ULPs or system mods for Eagle.

ULP Idea
Right click context to switch layers to what object is on. Line, route, rectangle, polygon, 

ULP Idea
Make a right-click item for parts to update library that part is from. Helpful after making edits from the right-click "edit package" option.

ULP Idea.
Settings replacement menu. That could include the most used settings on one page (tabs?). Include view/tool settings and menu defualts lists.

ULP Idea.
Match endpoint ulp. Run, then select 1st endpoint with group, then second endpoint to match. Ulp would copy location of 1st endpoint to the 2nd.
To solve these kind of problems.

CORE:
- Shortcut modifiers. Ability to modify shortcut options from menu (or other shortcuts)
	

- LAYER: Create a running history of display settings to enable BACK and FORWARD. Just like web browser.

	

- DISPLAY:
	-> Highlight layer focus. Currently a thin dotted border.
	-> On dialog OK, change layer to last in focus. Or at least keep tools from turning on hidden layers.
		- Keep a history and use the last changed layer for the layers still visible.

- DISPLAY replacement ulp:
	-> Layer change on exit.
	-> Checkboxes for show (can it do an apply when changing checkboxes?)
	-> Highlight modes radio items. No fill, semi-fill, solid-fill.
	-> Grayscale mode to remove color (setup grayscale section of palette)
	-> Per project display aliases

ULP:
- Utility to compare against any argv. This has to be implemented somewhere that can by turned into an easy function call.

- Copy group to next layer ulp.

- Functions to handle cfgget and set and would do the type conversions. (real to str, int to string, etc)

DONE - Found trace-layer.ulp - Ulp to Solo layer and cycle for single layer checking.

- Schematic context item "Add to brd group". Would add selected part to the current board group.

- Display presests which use layer fill changes to create high contrast modes.
	- Started with scr files to experiment with fill settings

- GROUP INFO: Ulp to run info on group. Group does not allow group activation of INFO tool. I think I remember seeing a ulp somewhere.

- Context menu for polygon to pour individual.
	-> Pour Manager: 

- UlP to hide all layers (SET USED) that do not contain any objects.

Set shortcut to PRESET launcher.
	Set preset option from text menu (stored in eaglerc.user)
	- CFGTOGGLE Usage idea. Set preset options from POUR menu, that way pour preset (F5) can be changed from the menu. (pour gnd or only v nets).
