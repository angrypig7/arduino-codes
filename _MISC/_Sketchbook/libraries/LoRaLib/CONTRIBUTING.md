# Contributing to LoRaLib

First of all, thank you very much for taking the time to contribute! All feedback and ideas are greatly appreciated.
To keep this library organized, please follow these rules.

1. **Questions are welcome, spam is not.**  
Any issues without description will be considered spam and as such will be **CLOSED** and **LOCKED** immediately!
2. **This repository has issue templates.**  
To report bugs or suggest new features, use the provided issue templates. Use the default issue only if the templates do not fit your issue type.
3. **Be as clear as possible when creating issues.**  
Issues with generic titles (e.g. "not working", "lora", etc.) will be **CLOSED** until the title is fixed, since the title is supposed to categorize the issue. The same applies for issues with very little information and gramatical or formatting errors that make it difficult to find out what is the actual issue.
4. **Issues deserve some attention too.**  
Issues that are left for 2 weeks without response by the original author when asked for further information will be closed due to inactivity. This is to keep track of important issues, the author is encouraged to reopen the issue at a later date.
5. **LoRaLib is a driver.**  
This means that only features available in the SX127x chips will be implemented. LoRaLib will not implement protocols such as LoRaWAN.
