TCPIP stack introduction
========================

This stack is a minimalistic implementation of the IP/UDP/TCP
protocols. Small codesize and minimal RAM usage were the major
requirements, this is not a full-fledged implementation of the defining
RFC documents.

Included with the stack is a SLIP/PPP implementation with support for
Hayes compatible modems, capable of dialing in to commercial internet
providers, or receiving calls from out-of-the-box PPP-clients. To
facilitate the dial-in process a basic DNS server is running, so users
can browse to a hostname instead of an IP-number.

An alternative transport layer is ethernet, with basic DHCP and ARP
support.

An HTTP server is included. Although basic it should be sufficient for
a lot of implementations. Its most distinguishing ability is to create
a simple CGI-interface to chosen C-variables, based on a single
definition line for each variable. It even optionally generates a human
usable HTML-form on top of the same CGI interface. By default it serves
pages from hardcode bytearrays.

An FTP server allows access to a FAT-based filesystem, the same
filesystem is optionally available to the HTTP server.

Finally a TELNET server, a DNS client and a SMTP client are present.
The TELNET server is only a skeleton demo but can be used as a starting
point for further development, the combination DNS/SMPT client is
directly usable to send mail from a device to the outside world.

Last but not least: all features can be included on a "as needed"
basis, where functionality not included is not compiled.
